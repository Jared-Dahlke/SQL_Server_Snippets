--this doc is a compilation of helpful code snippets. I use many of these every day:


--Get Definition of a stored procedure by name:

SELECT definition  
FROM sys.sql_modules  
WHERE object_id = (OBJECT_ID(N'GetDQMData'));  


--Get definition of a view by name:

select definition
from sys.objects     o
join sys.sql_modules m on m.object_id = o.object_id
where o.object_id = object_id( 'dbo.MyView')
  and o.type      = 'V'


-- Get definition of a trigger by name:


select so.name, text
from sysobjects so, syscomments sc
where type = 'TR'
and so.id = sc.id
and text like '%ictransfer%'




--Get all tables that have a particular column name:

   SELECT      c.name  AS 'ColumnName'
            ,t.name AS 'TableName'
FROM        sys.columns c
JOIN        sys.tables  t   ON c.object_id = t.object_id
WHERE       c.name LIKE '%suggested%'
ORDER BY    TableName
            ,ColumnName;




--Update from a select statement:

UPDATE
    Table_A
SET
    Table_A.col1 = Table_B.col1,
    Table_A.col2 = Table_B.col2
FROM
    Some_Table AS Table_A
    INNER JOIN Other_Table AS Table_B
        ON Table_A.id = Table_B.id
WHERE
    Table_A.col3 = 'cool'



--declare and set 3 variables:

Declare @DQMID varchar(55)
Declare @Path varchar(2000)
Declare @FileName varchar(2000)

select 
@DQMID = DQMID, 
@Path = Path, 
@FileName = FileName
From (
select DQMID, Path, FileName from myTableName
) x



--create a trigger that fires when a record gets inserted into a table, and pull info from the inserted record so we can work with it:

create trigger t_SendDocUploadNotif on CompMatrixDocuments
After Insert as
BEGIN

  Declare @DQMID varchar(55)
  Declare @Path varchar(2000)
  Declare @FileName varchar(2000)

  select 
  @DQMID = DQMID, 
  @Path = Path, 
  @FileName = FileName
  From (
  select DQMID, Path, FileName from inserted
  ) x

  update sometable set   colA = @Path, colB = @FileName where ID = @DQMID

END
